Hi, Iâ€™m Khandakar Shakir Hossain. I have over 10 years of experience in software testing and more than 3 years in automation, specializing in API testing, microservices validation, and CRM integration. I am skilled in designing scalable automation frameworks, integrating CI/CD pipelines, and improving release stability. I have leveraged AI-driven solutions such as Playwright MCP Server, GitHub Copilot, and LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude) to streamline automation, reducing test creation effort by 35% and increasing coverage. I am experienced in guiding QA teams and implementing process improvements for large-scale enterprise applications. I collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products while leading QA initiatives and driving continuous improvement across projects.
